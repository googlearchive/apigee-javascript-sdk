<!-- APIGEE JavaScript SDK COLLECTION EXAMPLE APP

This sample app will show you how to perform basic operations on collections using the Apigee JavaScript SDK, including:
	
	- creating an empty collection
	- adding one or more entities to a collection
	- retrieving and paging through a collection
	- deleting entities from a collection
	
** IMPORTANT - BEFORE YOU BEGIN **

Be sure to include the Apigee JavaScript SDK (apigee.js) in your code like on ln 35 below.

All done? Great, let's get started! -->
